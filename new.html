  <p>The cycle begins with the search for a suitable 
    partner to fill a defined need or capacity gap 
    within the microinsurance programme. Initial 
    analysis should identify whether there is a 
    need for a partner organization, and, if so, the 
    rationale for seeking a partnership arrangement. 
    The purpose of the partnership, the requirements 
    for a suitable partner and the objectives 
    expected from the partnership should be clearly 
    laid out. This analysis forms the groundwork for 
    identifying and assessing potential partners
    The intended partnership should support the strategic 
    objectives of the partner organizations, and, given the 
    low premiums inherent in microinsurance, should 
    improve the programme’s potential through expanding 
    value for clients and/or contributing to viability</p>
    <h1 id="Assessment and Selection">Assessment and Selection</h1>
    <p>The specific capacities and needs of each potential 
        partner should be evaluated against the partnership 
        objectives and desired attributes of a partner. Virtually 
        all organizations interviewed identified aligned 
        interests and objectives as a key component of a 
        successful partnership. Objectives need to be aligned at 
        different organizational levels – operational as well as 
        managerial – in order to ensure effective implementation.
        It is crucial to consider what benefits the microinsurance 
        programme will bring to its partners and whether these 
        benefits are sufficient to attract and maintain a partner's 
        commitment to the project. A key insight from the study 
        is that microinsurance partnerships must provide benefits 
        to the distribution channel in addition to commissions 
        in order to be successful in the long term. Commissions 
        from microinsurance policies are generally small, and 
        thus may be insufficient alone to ensure commitment from 
        a distribution partner. The microinsurance programme 
        will need to contribute positively and sufficiently to 
        each partner’s core business and objectives in order 
        to be sustainable over the long term (Box 1 includes 
        an example from Old Mutual in South Africa).
        One approach is for organizations to use an assessment 
        questionnaire during the partner selection process. 
        Such an assessment tool can be used to do a selfassessment
        (within different areas of the organization 
        and overall) and to guide discussions between partners. 
        A third party can be used to facilitate the process. This 
        can provide a more objective and consistent analysis 
        of the motivations and capacities of the partners that 
        allows for greater dialogue and collaboration</p>
        <h1 id="Implementation">Implementation</h1>
        <p>The Implementation stage involves reaching agreement 
            on the partnership terms and establishing the necessary 
            agreements to launch the project. The first part of this stage 
            (outlined in Box 2) includes designing the partnership 
            and incentive structures and creating an initial joint 
            business plan. This part may also include developing 
            a preliminary Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) 
            in order to set ground rules for the partnership. Once it 
            is confirmed that the project will proceed, the partners 
            need to work through any remaining steps, including 
            defining roles and responsibilities, resolving operational 
            issues and establishing appropriate communication.
            as systems development or marketing. A microinsurance
            business plan should include realistic timeframes and 
            expectations for the programme to become sustainable. 
            The business plan should be prepared jointly in 
            order to manage the expectations of all partners. 
            Unrealistic financial goals can have negative results.
            Effective implementation of microinsurance partnerships 
            includes a collaborative dialogue between the partners 
            that develops trust, understanding and commitment, and 
            usually concludes with the formalization of the partnership 
            through a contractual agreement. Drafting a contractual 
            agreement can be a technical or legal process, and 
            may not facilitate discussion between operational staff. 
            Therefore, before getting to the contractual process, 
            partners should conduct a dialogue that involves all levels 
            and functions of the organizations to ensure understanding 
            and buy-in from all stakeholders within the organizations.
            Implementation of a microinsurance partnership 
            will normally conclude with formalising the terms 
            of the partnership in a written agreement. If a 
            MoU was previously created, then it may be 
            replaced by a legal agreement at this point. 
            A formal written agreement is important because the 
            process of drafting it forces all parties to be clear about 
            the partnership objectives, roles and responsibilities, 
            and expected outcomes, and it establishes a roadmap 
            to manage the partnership. By itself, however, a 
            written agreement will not automatically lead to a 
            successful partnership. What is more important is the 
            trust and commitment demonstrated in the relationship 
            between the partners and the outcome of the 
            dialogue and negotiation during the implementation 
            of the partnership. In some situations a more informal 
            agreement or an agreement that is not very detailed 
            may provide more flexibility and innovation, provided 
            there is sufficient commitment from the partners.</p>
            <h1 id="Maintenance">Maintenance</h1>
            <p>Key success factors at the Maintenance stage include 
                collaborative product development, regular and effective 
                communication, and prompt conflict resolution.
                Slow growth or financial progress can challenge a 
                partnership. A partnership structured around learning 
                objectives, at least initially, can have a greater 
                chance of successfully retaining commitment. In such a 
                learning partnership continued commitment depends 
                on recognizing the learning that has taken place, 
                even when financial progress is incremental. The initial 
                objectives are focused on understanding the factors 
                that will lead to a successful program rather than only 
                on specific statistics such as sales or claims. Setting 
                specific learning objectives for a pilot, and documenting 
                results and successes, provides evidence to the partners 
                and other stakeholders that the project is moving 
                forward. If managed well, a learning partnership 
                allows for more flexibility to adapt the project. This 
                may not necessarily prevent problems, but it enables 
                a more collaborative problem-solving approach. 
                A lesson from the study is that multi-stakeholder 
                partnerships require a strong central role to manage 
                the project and resolve potential conflicts. In many 
                cases bilateral MoUs or agreements are developed 
                separately between the partners in a multi-partner 
                arrangement; a single overarching MoU may be 
                required in order to provide adequate collaboration.</p>
